# ML-Age-estimation-from-facial-images
Code was built in matlab. Dataset used was of FGNET.<br>
#### To run files:
First file named preprocessing.m must be compiled and run then compile file named feature extraction so that we .mat file with all feature values.<br> For clustering part file named fcm_age is tested and estimated age is calculated based on fuzzy c- means clustering algorithm. Binary age group >30 and <30 years are classified using SVM classifier.
